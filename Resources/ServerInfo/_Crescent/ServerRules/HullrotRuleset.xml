# HULLROT Rules
[color=#ff0000]HULLROT[/color]

HULLROT is a roleplaying project and all participants of the game build the environment that creates an interesting and enjoyable story. Members not respecting the setting of the game will not be present again.

As the name suggests, Taypan - the void where the game takes place is not a kind and forgiving place and we create it together. You will die and separate with your belongings - don't let this get to you and never let down your mask despite the circumstances.

Evil exists in this world and is condoned in many cases. For instance, sabotaging the main reactor of the enemy's base to blow it up is smart and effective tactic, punish them for their lack of oversight. Though if this becomes repetitive, the game can quickly get sour and boring for all parties involved and quickly turn into an e-sports event.

Killing another player is a quick and effective method of resolving a conflict but try your best to keep it interesting. Hostages are often worth a lot more.

[color=#ff0000]Q:[/color] Is there a wiki?
    [color=#00ff00]A:[/color] https://hullrot.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page - do note this wiki is a work in progress; articles may be incomplete! This fan-made wiki also has a good primer on ship combat (but is otherwise largely outdated): https://ncwldocs.github.io/guides/ships/

[color=#ff0000]Q:[/color] Where can I join the discord?
    [color=#00ff00]A:[/color] Main Discord: https://discord.gg/S5VTFSwPEe (permanent link); additionally, we have a separate Discord for communicating with members of your faction post-round: https://discord.gg/nAFYNnZfUt

[color=#ff0000]Q:[/color] I can't see the general chat on the main Discord, what do I do?
    [color=#00ff00]A:[/color] Play the game! If your respective faction leader, or a staff member notices you they will vouch for you to get in.
  
[color=#ff0000]Q:[/color] Where can I find the lore?
    [color=#00ff00]A:[/color] A summary of Hullrot's lore timeline is available here: https://hullrot.miraheze.org/wiki/Timeline - however, much player lore also exists. Talk to others on our Discord.

[color=#ff0000]Q:[/color] When does the server go up?
    [color=#00ff00]A:[/color] The game is tested erratically, and usually on weekends. Not every weekend is a guaranteed testlaunch. Uptimes can be found on the Discord either in the #announcements channel or the events tab.

[color=#ff0000]Q:[/color] What are the rules of this server?
    [color=#00ff00]A:[/color] Check the ⁠#guidelines channel on the Discord for some directions. While we are a fairly lax server in terms of not having many concrete rules, we expect you to play in good faith. No slurs, harassment, be civil etc.
