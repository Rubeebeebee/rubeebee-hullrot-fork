The loadout tab features a number of cosmetic and utility items that you can choose to spawn in with. Some items have point costs or are mutually exclusive with other items from the same category.
Hovering over a given item will show its description as well as any conditions for selecting it. Note that available uniforms and armor pieces change depending on the faction/job you play.
